# MIT Engaging High Performance Compute Cluster

The Engaging High Performance Compute Cluster is available to LINC team members to process their jobs at scale, including with the use of GPUs.

## Create an account

In order to access the Engaging Cluster, you will need a MIT Sponsored Account.

1. Please contact Kabi at kabi@mit.edu with your organization name, date of birth, and phone number.
2. Once the sponsored account is approved, you will receive an email to complete account registration and establish your MIT Kerberos identity.
3. Please send your Kerberos ID to Kabi so that he can add you to the WebMoira group (`orcd_ug_pg_linc_all`) so that you can access the Engaging Cluster.

## Documentation

The [Engaging Cluster Documentation](https://engaging-web.mit.edu/eofe-wiki/) has details regarding:
1. [Logging into the cluster](https://engaging-web.mit.edu/eofe-wiki/logging_in/)
1. [Cluster architecture including information on the head/login nodes versus compute nodes](https://engaging-web.mit.edu/eofe-wiki/slurm/cluster_workflow/)
1. [Common commands to interact with the Slurm Job Scheduler](https://engaging-web.mit.edu/eofe-wiki/slurm/slurm/)
1. [Run multiple jobs in parallel with `sbatch`](https://engaging-web.mit.edu/eofe-wiki/slurm/sbatch/)
1. [Run interactive jobs on a single compute node with `srun` or `salloc`](https://engaging-web.mit.edu/eofe-wiki/slurm/srun/)
1. [Access installed software](https://engaging-web.mit.edu/eofe-wiki/software/load_modules/)

## Best practices

1. Please be respectful of these resources as they are used by many groups.
1. Only run resource intensive scripts on the compute nodes and not on the login/head nodes.
