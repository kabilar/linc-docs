The center for [Large-scale Imaging of Neural Circuits (LINC)](https://connects.mgh.harvard.edu/)
 (PIs: Haber, Hillman, Yendiki) is funded by the
 [NIH BRAIN Initiative CONNECTS program](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/news-events/highlights-announcements/nih-brain-initiative-launches-projects-develop-innovative-technologies-map-brain-incredible-detail).
Its goal is to develop novel technologies for imaging brain connections down to 
the microscopic scale, and deploy these technologies to image 
cortico-subcortical projections that are relevant to deep brain stimulation for 
motor and psychiatric disorders.

## About this doc

The LINC documentation is meant to share information across the LINC project investigators.  If you are new to the LINC project, you can start on the [Upload data](upload.md) page for a description of how to interact with the LINC data sharing platform.

Since the LINC infrastructure is a fork of the DANDI Archive, please refer to the [DANDI Docs](https://docs.dandiarchive.org) for comprehensive documentation.
